# LinkFlow for Obsidian


A visual, all-in-one link manager for Obsidian. Centralize your web links in a single note, and LinkFlow transforms them into a stunning gallery of cards with automatic metadata scraping, powerful filters, and reading statuses.



## ✨ Key Features

- 📸 **Automatic Metadata Scraping**: Automatically fetches titles, descriptions, preview images, and favicons from any URL (including YouTube, social media, and news sites).
- 🚀 **Bulk Link Extraction**: Paste a block of text containing multiple URLs, and LinkFlow will intelligently extract and process all of them at once.
- 🎨 **Premium Dashboard UI**: A beautiful, responsive interface with two view modes:
    - **Grid Mode**: Perfect for visual browsing with large preview cards.
    - **List Mode**: Ideal for quick scanning and mobile use.
- 🌍 **Multi-language Support**: Fully localized in 5 languages: English, French, Spanish, German, and Italian.
- 📂 **Markdown-Native Storage**: Your data stays in your vault. Links are stored in a simple, human-readable `linkflow` code block within a markdown file of your choice.
- 🔍 **Advanced Filtering & Sorting**:
    - Search by title, description, or site name.
    - Filter by status (Unread, Read, All) or Archive.
    - Sort by Date Added (Newest/Oldest), Title, or Site.
- ⚡ **Instant Sync**: The dashboard updates in real-time as you add links to your source file or modify them in the UI.
- 📊 **Custom Block Rendering**: The `linkflow` code block is rendered as a beautiful, interactive table in Obsidian's Reading Mode.
